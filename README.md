# Project Abstract
Our project is to create an Alexa skill that can provide information about Temple University, such as building location, open hours, and academic schedule. Users can just simply ask "Hey Hooter, what time does IBC close today?", the skill will get the information from the database stored on Amazon Web Service and answer to users. The database will be continuously updated, unlike Google result's hours, which might not be correct during different holidays.

# Expectations for team members
Everyone will partcipate in the assignment. We will all meet up as a group and work together about once a week. We will all have various tasks to do on Trello and Github. We will all write code, edit the readMe, and have fun.

# Project Relevance
The project is linked with several educational goals that are introduced in class, such as remote procedure calls and access to the database. Basically, when the user asks Alexa to activate skill "Hooter", it will search in the remote skill database and launch the skill with matching name. Also, all the data that the skill uses is also stored in a web server, so data accessing will be used. These are important goals because these two capabilities are commonly used in today applications.
We are already familiar with Trello, Github, API, and Java. We have to learn more about Amazon skill and lambda functions.

# Goals and Milestones
One milestone that we have is to connect the database to our lambda function. Another milestone we have is to gain permission from Temple ITS department to grant us developer access to Canvas and its API. One goal we have is to provide building times and locations to Temple students. Another goal is to, help students lookup events that are happening on campus and in the academic calendar. We want to provide login ability for Canvas accounts.
The Software Development Process that we are using is plan driven. We are not testing as much and we are looking up resources to achieve our goals and milestones. We will be giving in class presentation on April 19th about Alexa skill.
